# Future Improvements for Personal Sticker App

This file tracks potential features and enhancements for the application.

### Enhanced Customization & Control

- [ ] **Custom Expressions:** Allow users to add their own text prompts for expressions (e.g., "Mind Blown," "Sipping Tea") instead of being limited to the predefined list.
- [x] **Style Selection:** Add a dropdown to let users choose the artistic style of their stickers, such as "Photo-realistic," "Anime," or "3D Render."
- [ ] **Negative Prompts:** Include an input field for things to *exclude* from the image (e.g., "no text," "no hats") to help refine the AI's output.

### Better User Experience (UX)

- [x] **Individual Sticker Progress:** Show a spinner on each sticker card as it's being generated. (Implemented)
- [ ] **Save Sessions:** Use the browser's local storage to save the user's last generated sticker pack. If they close the tab and come back, their work won't be lost.
- [ ] **"Regenerate" Button:** Add a small "redo" button on each generated sticker. If a user isn't happy with one specific result, they can regenerate it without having to start the entire batch over.
- [ ] **Error Handling Per Sticker:** If a single sticker fails to generate, show an error icon on that card instead of stopping the whole process, with an option to retry.
- [x] **True Transparency:** Remove checkered boxes and implement transparent png photos with a fine-tuning editor.
- [x] **Display Size Toggler:** Allow the user to control the sticker grid size (Small, Medium, Large).
- [x] **Integrated Expression Management:** Remove the separate management card and allow users to add/delete expressions directly from the sticker grid.


### Advanced Features

- [ ] **Animated Stickers:** Explore using an AI model capable of generating short animations to create animated GIF stickers.
- [ ] **Text Overlays:** After a sticker is generated, allow the user to add custom text on top of it directly in the app before downloading.
- [ ] **AI Expression Suggestions:** Use a text-based AI model to analyze the uploaded character and suggest a list of funny or fitting expressions tailored to it.

### Analytics & Monetization

- [ ] **Usage Analytics:** Integrate a tool like Google Analytics to track user events (uploads, generations, downloads) to understand user behavior.
- [ ] **API Key Management:** For a standalone app, implement a secure way for users to enter their own Gemini API key.
